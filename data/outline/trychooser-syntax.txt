In the last video I talked about how to push a patch to try to get builds and tests run on that
patch.

As part of that video I talked about needing to create a second patch with a special message.
That patch indicates what builds to create and which tests to run.

In that video I just pasted a string for that special message. In this video I'll show you how to generate your own.

You can actually create the message yourself, but it's a lot easier to use this handy tool at:
http://trychooser.pub.build.mozilla.org/

The first radio button is for debug, release, or both.

The next section is for OS. You usually want all OS unless your code touches only a specific OS.
You can also restrict tests to a certain platform.
Then you can specify which tests to run, you usually want all tests.
It may be useful if you're troubleshooting an individual test type for example to only run that.

You don't usually need the talos suite which is for performance, unless you're adding code to starutp, or unless
you suspect you're affecting perf.

----

Only push for what you need. For example if you're making a change to some win32 code that only runs on windows, you don't need to run
that on other platforms.

Any custom mozconfig options go in:
build/mozconfig.common.override

Copy the generated test string.
hg qnew try_all_options_no_talos -m "<paste>"
hg push -f try
